  abstract = {This paper develops a growth theory that captures the replacement
              of physical capital accumulation by human capital accumulation as a
              prime engine of growth along the process of development. It argues
              that the positive impact of inequality on the growth process was
              reversed in this process. In early stages of the Industrial
              Revolution, when physical capital accumulation was the prime source
              of growth, inequality stimulated development by channelling
              resources towards individuals with a higher propensity to save. As
              human capital emerged as a growth engine, equality alleviated
              adverse effects of credit constraints on human capital accumulation
              , stimulating the growth process.},
